# GoalTender

This is a simple and configurable goal tracker.

GoalTender makes it quick and easy to keep track of things like:

* weight loss
* exercising
* practicing skills
* remembering repetitive tasks
* tracking events
* whatever you can measure or check off.


When you create a Goal, you give it a name, choose a goal type, choose a time period, and select a target value (if appropriate).

You can choose time periods of:
* Daily
* Named days of the week
* Weekly
* Monthly
* None

GoalTender offers three types of goals:
* Value
* Cumulative
* Checkbox

A "Value" goal is a simple numerical value you record, such as your weekly weight or fastest time.

A "Cumulative" goal is numerical value you record that is cumulative: such as minutes spent walking, calories eaten, time spent studying, etc.

A "Checkbox" goal is just a "I did that" goal, such as "Clean the kitchen" or "Organize one room".


So, for example, if you create a goal called "Walking", and set it to be "Daily" and "Cumulative",
you can log several entries on the goal per day, and GoalTender will add them together appropriately.

And if you want to weigh yourself weekly, create a goal called "Weight" and set it to "Value" and "Weekly".
You can weigh yourself more than once a week, and the values will not be added together.

For both "Cumulative" and "Value" goals, you set a target value and unit of measure, and whether the target is a maximum or minimum.
For example, for "Weight" you might set it to "60 kg" and mark that as maximum, so that GoalTender can
help show if you're over or under the value.  And for "Walking", you'd set the target at, say, "30 min" and that'd be a minimum.


Notifications
-------------

When you open GoalTender, it will show the list of Goals you have not yet met for the Day, Week, and Month.
Simply click on the name to create an entry for that Goal. If you have met all the goals for the current period,
it will instead show a list of the entries you've already made. If you miss a day (or other time period), the app
will not list those missed entries as "todo" (these are *Goals*, not scheduled activities).  You can manually add
past activities by using the menu and setting the date to a day in the past.

Optionally, GoalTender can send Android notifications on a regular schedule, from once a day to many times a day (configurable).


Support
-------
GoalTender should be considered "alpha, but usable": it is still in development and may/will change
significantly, but every effort will be taken to make your data upgradable.

Please report any bugs you find or suggestions on how you'd like the program to work.


Future
------

For now, GoalTender does not allow finer granularity than "Daily". Making half-day or hourly goals, or sending reminders at specific times
feels beyond the scope of what this app is for, namely, to help you keep track of your long-term goals.  A spreadsheet, scheduler, or
alarm app is more on target for finer-grained scheduling and tracking.  But you can sort of get there by making your
multi-times-a-day goals Daily and Cumulative.

With that in mind, suggestions and feed back are welcome!
